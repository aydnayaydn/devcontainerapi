Creating Dev Container with API Example in VS Code

# Summary
This project has been written to show you how you can quickly adapt to a new project by installing only VS Code and Docker Desktop on your computer.

# Case
You have a brand new computer with any os. You have to install all requirements (sdk's, IDE's, libraries, tools, vs code extensions, maybe databases, etc.). As you know, the IT department is very helpful about giving auth for all these installations. Is this process takes 2-3 workdays?

# Solution
You can create a yml file for all requirements inside. (see: /.devcontainer)
